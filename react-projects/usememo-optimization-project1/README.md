## About the Components

### `useMemo` Hook

The project utilizes the `useMemo` hook in the `Result` component. This hook is used to optimize calculations by memoizing results, preventing unnecessary recalculations, and improving performance.

### `App` Component

The `App` component, defined in `App.jsx`, serves as the entry point to the application. It integrates the `Name` and `Result` components. Additionally, it showcases memoization of a function using a closure. The function `sum2` is memoized to store previously calculated results.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project as you learn more about React. Happy coding!
